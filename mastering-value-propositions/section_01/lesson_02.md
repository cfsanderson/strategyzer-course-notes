___
### STEP 5: Best Practices

#### Mistakes:
1. Sketching out your customer profile with value proposition in mind
   - step into customer's shoes (empathy)
2. Focussing on too few Jobs, Pains, and Gains
3. Focussing on funtional jobs only
   - not just commuting to work, personal mobility, occasional long trip as in Tesla example
   - social and emotional too
4. Mixing jobs and outcomes
   - jobs describe WHAT they want to get done
   - pains describe what they want to AVOID
   - gains describe what they want to ACHIEVE
5. Being too vague with pains and gains
   - "250-350km" exactly vs "get to work"
6. Mixing too many **customers** into one profile
